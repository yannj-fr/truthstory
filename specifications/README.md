# TruthStory Specifications

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive specifications for all TruthStory components. These specifications serve as the single source of truth for development and should be updated before implementing any changes.

## Directory Structure

### `/services`
Service-specific specifications including:
- API definitions
- Service behaviors
- Error handling
- Performance requirements
- Testing criteria

### `/interfaces`
Interface specifications covering:
- Service-to-service communication
- External API interfaces
- User interfaces
- Demo interface requirements

### `/architecture`
System architecture specifications:
- Component diagrams
- Data flow descriptions
- Deployment models
- Security requirements
- Scalability considerations

### `/data-models`
Data structure specifications:
- Database schemas
- Message formats
- API payloads
- Validation rules

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Specification First
- All features must be specified before implementation
- Specifications should be reviewed and approved
- Changes to specs must be documented

### 2. Maintaining Specifications
- Keep specifications up to date
- Document all changes
- Version control important changes
- Link to relevant issues/PRs

### 3. Implementation References
- Reference specific specifications in code
- Update specs when implementation constraints are discovered
- Document any deviations from specs

### 4. Review Process
- Specifications require review
- Changes need approval
- Impact analysis required
- Testing criteria must be included

## Format Guidelines
